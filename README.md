**My Portfolio**



**#Description#**

 This is a project to create a portfolio webpage from scratch using html and css styling. The webpage needs to be responsive under different resolutions. This webpage provides some information about me, the work I have done in the past, and my contact information. The nav bar at the right top takes to their section when clicked. The second section portfolio has the first project where I refactored the code which has the biggest image of all. All the images (image2 and 3 are placeholders for future projects) when clicked will take to their corresponding webpage. The third section provides the contact section which has a link and opens on a new window.

The webpage uses different sections/ids and their respective style from css. I have mostly used flex styling to make it a more responsive design. Upon inspecting the webpage on various media, the responsive design/pattern will be responded to fit the different screen sizes. Media queries were added to override the default values.

Code has been deployed on GitLab. link below:
